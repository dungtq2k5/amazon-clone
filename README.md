First! Thanks to "SuperSimpleDev" for creating an awsome JavaScript tutorial - continuing to his HTML-CSS tutorial for beginner that I've already wachted. After following-watching-listening-doing step by step throughout his video I gained many knowledge about JavaScript like:
- Combining HTML-CSS-JS together.
- Making the buttons interactive with the user when click on them.
- Implementing HTML code through JS.
- Spawning some logic about objects, DOM with JS.
  
By following his tutorial at the end I can manage to create this "amazon-clone" project by myselft. Thanks to him again!
