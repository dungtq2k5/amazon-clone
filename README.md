Thanks to "SuperSimpleDev"! After watching his Javascript tutorials full course that I've learnt so much things like some basic-structure about Js code, combine HTML-CSS-JS while doing some small projects "Todo-list", "Rock-paper-scissors",... And final he instructed me to create a nice project "Amazon.com".
