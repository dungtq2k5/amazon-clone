First! Thanks to "SuperSimpleDev" for creating an awesome JavaScript tutorial "JavaScript Full Course (2023) - Beginner to Pro - Part 1(2)" - continuing to his "HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro" that I've already watched. After following-watching-listening-doing step by step throughout his video, I gained much knowledge about JavaScript:
- Combining HTML-CSS-JS.
- Making the buttons interactive with the user when clicking on them.
- Implementing HTML code through JS.
- Spawning some logic about objects, DOM with JS.
  
By following his tutorial at the end I can manage to create this "amazon-clone" project by myself. Thanks to him again!
